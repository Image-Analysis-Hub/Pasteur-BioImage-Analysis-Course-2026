## Session 1: Lecture: Deep Learning for Microscopy Image Analysis using BiaPy

In the lecture, we will explore [BiaPy](https://biapyx.github.io/), a powerful and accessible toolbox designed to help train deep learning models for microscopy image analysis. We will start with an introduction to deep learning and its applications in microscopy, followed by a discussion of how BiaPy simplifies the process of building and applying neural networks, even for those with limited computational resources.

## Session 2: Hands-on: Preparing, Training, and Evaluating a Deep Learning Model for Instance Segmentation in Microscopy

In this hands-on session, you will gain practical experience with the full workflow of training a deep learning model for instance segmentation tasks in microscopy, using the BiaPy platform. This session integrates three crucial stages of deep learning workflows: 1) data preparation, 2) training the model and 2) model evaluation and deployment.

**Part1: Preparing Data and Training an Instance Segmentation Model**

You will begin by learning how to prepare your data for deep learning, which includes annotating microscopy images and setting up a training dataset suitable for instance segmentation. Through guided practice, you will learn to:

- Annotate images effectively for segmentation tasks.

- Organize and format your dataset for model training.

- Train a deep learning model to segment cells in microscopy images.

By the end of this segment, you will have hands-on experience in training a deep learning model on microscopy data.

**Part 2: Evaluating Model Quality and Applying It to New Data**

Once your model is trained, you will move on to the next phase: Quality Control (QC). Ensuring that your model is robust and generalizes well to new data is essential in any deep learning project. This part of the session will cover:

- The importance of QC in DL-based segmentation.

- Techniques to evaluate the model’s performance using training history and validation results.

- Visualization and inspection of model outputs for quality assessment.

- Deployment of the trained model to segment new, unseen datasets.

By the end of this segment, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge and tools to conduct thorough QC and confidently apply your model to real-world microscopy data.

# Topic 2: Tracking with TrackMate I

This course is aimed at beginners in bioimage analysis, that wants to learn how to analyse time-lapse movies. Such movies can follow the movement of cells, in 2D or 3D over time, or the motility of organelles and large objects. They offer unique insight into the dynamics of biology objects, on the evolution of their morphology and of molecular processes, imaged via transmission light or fluorescence microscopy. 

The course starts a brief theoretical introduction about tracking algorithms, and is followed by a hands-on tutorial. For the tutorial we will use TrackMate (https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/), which is a somewhat popular Fiji plugin for tracking, developed in the Image Analysis Hub.

## Preparing for the practicals

If it is not done already, download and install a fresh Fiji: https://fiji.sc/ 

For the practicals of today, we will learn how to use TrackMate with demo images. 
Please download them from here in advance:

The zipped folder contains the demo files required for the practicals, and PDFs of the TrackMate manuals (you don't have to read them!!).
You can also follow the documentation online: https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/ (not required for the course!!)
